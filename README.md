## Code Snippet from Postman: (snippet goes here)
This code snippet shows some steps from the instructions.

Add water or oil 1 tablespoon at a time if the paste becomes too dry. Don't burn the paste. Lower the fire slightly if needed.\r\nAdd the cloves, cardamom, tamarind pulp, coconut milk, water, sugar and salt. Turn the heat up and bring the mixture to boil. Turn the heat to medium low and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir occasionally. It will reduce slightly. This is the marinade/sauce, so taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Don't worry if it's slightly bitter. It will go away when roasting.\r\nWhen the marinade/sauce has cooled, pour everything over the chicken and marinate overnight to two days.\r\nPreheat the oven to 425 F.\r\nRemove the chicken from the marinade. Spoon the marinade onto a greased (or aluminum lined) baking sheet. Lay the chicken on top of the sauce (make sure the chicken covers the sauce and the sauce isn't exposed or it'll burn) and spread the remaining marinade on the chicken. Roast for 35-45 minutes or until internal temp of the thickest part of chicken is at least 175 F.\r\nLet chicken rest for 5 minutes. Brush the chicken with some of the oil. Serve chicken with the sauce over steamed rice (or coconut rice).",

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Build app with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
- Style with flexbox
- Use axios to make a request to an API and insert data from that API onto the page.
- have random recipe with picture of random recipe show up on page after clicking button.
- Make the design responsive with media queries. 
- Put website onto GitHub Pages.

#### PostMVP  

- Add a way to filter the recipes. (i.e. sort by vegetarian or gluten free)
- Add local storage so the user can save recipes they like for future use.
- Add a filter where users can input ingredients they already have to generate receipes they could make.

## Code Snippet

Function that fetches information from the API for all parts of a random recipe and appends it to the page. 

```
async function fetchRecipeName() {
  removeRecipe();
  try {
    const baseUrl = "www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php";
    let res = await axios.get(`https://boiling-mountain-84087.herokuapp.com/${baseUrl}`)
    // console.log(res.data.meals[0]);
    const recipe = res.data.meals[0];
    console.log(recipe);
    const mealName = recipe.strMeal;
    // console.log(mealName);
    const h2 = document.createElement("h2");
    h2.innerText = mealName;
    randomRecipe.appendChild(h2);
    // ingredients:
    let ingredient = [];
    let measurement = [];
    for (let key in recipe) {

      if (key.includes("strIngredient") && recipe[key] != "" && recipe[key] !== null) {
        ingredient.push(recipe[key]);
        // console.log(recipe[key]);
      }
      if (key.includes("strMeasure") && recipe[key] != "" && recipe[key] !== null) {
        measurement.push(recipe[key]);
        // console.log(recipe[key]);
      }
      // console.log(ingredient, measurement);
    }
    const ingredients = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < ingredient.length; i++) {
      let str = `${measurement[i]} ${ingredient[i]}`;
      ingredients.push(str);
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < ingredients.length; i++) {
      if (ingredients[i] !== "") {
        const li = document.createElement("li");
        li.innerText = ingredients[i];
        ingredientsDiv.appendChild(li);
      }
      // console.log(typeof ingredients[i]);
    };
    // instructions:
    const instructions = recipe.strInstructions;
    const p = document.createElement("p");
    p.innerText = instructions;
    instructionsDiv.appendChild(p);
    // image:
    const recipePic = recipe.strMealThumb;
    const img = document.createElement("img");
    img.src = recipePic;
    img.alt = "picture of recipe";
    imageDiv.appendChild(img);
    // end image
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

## Change Log
 
 Switched API from spoontacular to the mealdb (spoontacular costs money now) 
 Altered which side of the screen the recipe picture will be on. It is to the left of the ingredients instead of to the right.
